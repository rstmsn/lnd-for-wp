# LND-For-WP
## A WordPress plugin for managing &amp; using your LND node.

### Description
This project is a fork of the project [rstmsn/lnd-for-wp](https://github.com/rstmsn/lnd-for-wp). LND For WP is a WordPress plugin that allows you to manage and use your LND node, right from your WordPress administration panel. It provides a fully functional wallet interface, allowing you to send and recieve funds across the Lightning Network with ease. The user interface is responsive and will adapt to fit any web enabled desktop, tablet or mobile device. You can search the Lightning Network graph, manage peer connections and open & close channels with ease.
The plugin has QR support, enabling basic encoding & decoding of QR codes.
LND For WP also adds a number of WordPress 'shortcodes', allowing you to embed LND functionality directly in your website pages and posts. New Shortcodes will be added with future versions, as needs & use cases arise.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. What is LND?
  LND stands for 'Lightning Network Daemon'. It's a software implementation of the 'Lightning Network', which is an open protocol layer that leverages the power of blockchains and smart contracts to make cheap, fast, private transactions available to anyone around the world. To learn more, visit [Lightning Labs - Technology Overview](https://lightning.engineering/technology.html).

#### 2. Where can I download the latest version of LND?
   https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases

#### 3. LND is up and running. Where are my macaroons?
  Your macaroon files are generated automatically by LND when it is started. Assuming you're running Bitcoin on mainnet, you would find them inside the data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet directory of your LND dir. By default, the LND dir is located at:
`~/.lnd` on Linux
`/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Lnd/` on Mac OSX
or `$APPDATA/Local/Lnd` on Windows.
